The program consists of several classes and functions:

RockPaperScissors: Manages the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It initializes user and computer scores, allows users to play by choosing an option, and evaluates the results. It also prompts users to play again and displays final scores.

RandomBox: Handles a game where users select from four boxes, one of which is a "false box." If selected, the game ends. It tracks the number of times the false box is chosen and allows replaying.

Menu: Manages user interactions, including login and registration. It securely handles password input using masked characters. It verifies credentials against a file and navigates to the user menu upon successful login.

getHiddenInput(): Captures masked input for passwords.

isValidLogin(): Checks user credentials against stored data.

registerUser (): Saves new user credentials to a file.

The main function initializes the menu for user interaction.
